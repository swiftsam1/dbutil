Database tool can be used to connect to MySQl/Oracle database. In case of Oracle database, tests can be run to verify Failover scenario (TAF/FAN) when using RAC

# Run regular queries
# Evaluate performance of the query. Time taken for the connection and time taken to execute the query.
# Run Load tests on a query.
# Run Concurrent threads to perform load test.
# Evaluate fail over in Oracle RAC
